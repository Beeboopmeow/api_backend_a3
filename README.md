# api_backend_a3
Repository for a project from my bachelor's degree in Computer Science, it consists of a back-end JavaScript RestFUL API using Express and Sequelize ORM for an e-commerce platform.

## Running
1. This project uses the PostgreSQL dialect with Sequelize, PostgreSQL installation available [here](https://www.postgresql.org/download/). (pgAdmin not needed if you have another database manager, such as [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/))
2. Clone the repository using **Git**.
3. Update the `config/dbConnect.js` file to match your database information.
4. Run the command *npm start* and the webserver should be open.
